# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Biomedical Engineering undergrad who likes to code and I have decided to collect some of my most _enjoyable_ projects.

I am no **hardcore coder**, but I am eager to improve with time and passion (_very unique and inspiring line_).

# Interests 

I like to automate boring processes and it usually takes more time to automate them than actually doing them.

Academically speaking I have great interests in Neuroscience, particulary about brain-computer interfaces where Computer Science and Medicine meet; here you will find projects about signal processing and feedback control, aspects commonly found in this area of research.
